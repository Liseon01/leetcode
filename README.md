This repository contains solutions for various LeetCode problems written in C++. Each file corresponds to a specific problem and is named following the format `leetcode_<problem_number>.cpp`. Below is the list of problems solved in this repository:

## Problems Solved

1. **[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)** (`leetcode_1.cpp`)  
   The classic problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.

2. **[Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)** (`leetcode_2.cpp`)  
   Solving addition of two numbers represented as linked lists.

3. **[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)** (`leetcode_3.cpp`)  
   Find the length of the longest substring with unique characters.

4. **[Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)** (`leetcode_4.cpp`)  
   A challenging problem involving finding the median of two sorted arrays.

5. **[Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)** (`leetcode_5.cpp`)  
   Determine the longest substring that is a palindrome.

6. **[Zigzag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)** (`leetcode_6.cpp`)  
   Reformat a string in a zigzag pattern for given rows.

7. **[Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)** (`leetcode_7.cpp`)  
   Reverse the digits of an integer while considering integer overflow.

8. **[String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)** (`leetcode_8.cpp`)  
   Implement the `atoi` function that converts a string to an integer.

9. **[Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)** (`leetcode_9.cpp`)  
   Check if a given integer is a palindrome.

10. **[Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/)** (`leetcode_10.cpp`)  
    Solve pattern matching using regular expressions. *(Needs review; revisit)*

## Notes
- The solutions aim to be clear and efficient, using optimal algorithms and data structures where possible.
- The `Regular Expression Matching` problem is flagged as "watch it again," indicating it may require further review or study.

## How to Run
